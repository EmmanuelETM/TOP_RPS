getComputerChoice() {
    randomly generates a number from 1 to 3
    if that random number is 1, it returns rock, or
    if that random number is 2, it returns paper, 
    else it returns scissors
}

getHumanChoice() {
    prompts the user to enter its move
    returns the value
}

create two variables to keep track of the human and computer scores

playRound() {
    try to convert the input to lower case
    if the user input is the same as the computer, console.log tie.
    logic of the game:
    the user wins when: user picks rock and computer scissors or user picks paper and computer picks rock or user picks scissors and computer picks scissors
    otherwise the computer wins.
    update the score variables
    console.log the winner and the points
}

playGame() {
    create count variable and set it to zero
    while count is less than 5
    invoke playRound() 
}
